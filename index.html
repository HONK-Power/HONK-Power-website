		<h1>Hello there</h1>

		<p>
			What u doing ? Are you ok ?<br />
			I hope you're ok.
		</p>
		<p>Do you like cheese ?</p>

		<h2>What is HONK Power ?</h2>

		<p>
			It's supposed to be an enterprise created by someone called J0y. It's not
			officially one so I (J0y) use it to sometimes mess with people and mostly
			for professional or self development projects.
		</p>

		<h3>So is it an enterprise or not ?</h3>

		<p>No(t yet).</p>

		<h2>What kind of stuff are you doing / making ?</h2>

		<p>
			<strong>I was doing a lot of programmation before</strong> but I decided,
			two years ago, to take a break and move out far from cities, in a rural
			place.<br />
			Lot of people didn't understand why a skinny geek passionate by gaming and
			sitting on a chair for most of his days wanted so badly to live in the
			countryside. Well, it's because of what I just said: I was sick of
			spending my days on videogames or my code because I was too afraid to go
			outside. I want to move, use my hands, my body, without being restricted
			by an urban place and its people.
		</p>

		<p>
			Anyway, it's been 2 years and I'm an adult now. I decided to start
			programming things again, but for things I want to do, not just for
			work.<br />
			I'm planning to create Minecraft mods and plugins again, because I still
			enjoy this game even after 11 years.<br />
			I'm also planning to create my own website, HONK Power's website (this one
			:D) and I would like to start my own business after my studies done.
		</p>

		<h2>Your english is bad.</h2>

		<p>
			I know, and I have an excuse: English is not my native language. In fact,
			I'm french, so my native language is (obviously) french. I'm writing this
			website in english to improve, thank you for understanding :)!
		</p>

		<h2>What the heck is this website ? It doesn't seem to be finished.</h2>

		<p>
			It's because it's indeed not finished. This website is still in
			development and used by the creator, J0y (hello :D), to improve in web
			development.
