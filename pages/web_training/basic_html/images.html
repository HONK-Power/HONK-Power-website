		<h1>Insert an image</h1>

		<h2>A simple image</h2>
		<p>The thing below is an image.</p>
		<img
			src="../../media/training/dummy_file.jpg"
			alt='Image of a Piranha plant (from the famous game series "Super Mario Bros") with human teeths.'
		/>

		<h2>Image with tooltip</h2>
		<p>The image below has a tooltip when you hover your mouse on it.</p>
		<img
			src="../../media/training/dummy_file.jpg"
			alt="Same picture than the first one."
			title="Wtf is that"
		/>

		<h2>Figures</h2>
		<p>
			<em
				>Before starting: "Figure" is the french word used to describe what I'm currently
				working on. It may be something else in english, like "feature" (I'm not sure).</em
			>
		</p>
		<p>The thing below is a figure.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="../../media/training/figures_training.png" alt="Hello there" />
		</figure>

		<h3>That's just an image. What's the difference with the previous one ?</h3>
		<p>Good question ! It all depends on what your image brings to the text:
			<ul>
				<li>
					If it doesn't provide any information (it's just an illustration for decoration):
					place the image in a paragraph.
				</li>
				<li>If it provides information: place the image in a figure.</li>
			</ul>
